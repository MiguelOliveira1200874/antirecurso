## About the Project ü§ì

"Antirecurso" initially began as an Android mobile app designed to help students studying for PRCMP (Princ√≠pios de Computa√ß√£o) exams. Over time, it has evolved into a comprehensive platform that caters to a broad range of academic subjects, accessible from any device with an internet connection.

Whether using a computer, tablet, or mobile phone, "antirecurso" provides numerous exercises in the form of short quizzes, each with 10 random questions. Upon completion, users receive immediate feedback and their performance is tracked on a scoreboard.

If you're a student seeking extra academic resources, check out "antirecurso" <a href="https://antirecurso.nei-isep.org" target="_blank">here</a>. It's a comprehensive tool for exam preparation.

## The Tech Stack üîß

For this project, we've transitioned to using the Next.js framework. It brings productivity and agility in development and allows us to build server-side rendering and static web applications.

Here's a quick rundown of the tech stack:

- **Next.js**: A top-tier open-source React front-end development web framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

- **Alpine.js**: A rugged, minimal framework for composing JavaScript behavior in your markup. It‚Äôs like Tailwind for JavaScript.

Together, these technologies provide the infrastructure to build dynamic, feature-rich web applications accessible from the comfort of your home ü§ó.
